1.
Performance on Uniformly Distributed Data: Interpolation search performs better than binary search on uniformly distributed data. This is because it uses the actual values of the keys to make educated guesses about where the desired key might be, potentially skipping over many irrelevant elements.

Time Complexity: The average case time complexity of interpolation search can be better than binary search. For uniformly distributed data, interpolation search has an average time complexity of O(log log n), while binary search has an average time complexity of O(log n). This makes interpolation search faster on large, uniformly distributed datasets.

2.
Yes, the performance of interpolation search will be affected if the data follows a different distribution. Interpolation search assumes that the data is uniformly distributed, which allows it to make accurate guesses about where a key might be located.

If the data is not uniformly distributed, the guesses made by interpolation search may be less accurate, leading to more comparisons and a higher time complexity. For example, in the worst-case scenario where data is exponentially distributed, the time complexity of interpolation search can degrade to O(n), making it no better than a linear search.

This is why it's important to understand the distribution of data before choosing a search algorithm. While interpolation search can be very efficient on uniformly distributed data, it may not be the best choice for data with a different distribution.

3.
The key part of the interpolation search algorithm that would need to be modified is the formula used to calculate the position of the probe (the index to be searched next).

In the standard interpolation search, the probe position is calculated based on the assumption that the values are uniformly distributed. This is done using the formula:

pos = lo + ((x - arr[lo]) * (hi - lo)) / (arr[hi] - arr[lo])

Here, x is the value to be searched, arr is the array, lo and hi are the lower and upper bounds of the subarray being searched, and pos is the calculated position.

If the data follows a different distribution, this formula would need to be adjusted to accurately reflect that distribution. The exact modification would depend on the specific distribution of the data.

For example, if the data was exponentially distributed, you might need to use a logarithmic function in the calculation. If the data was distributed according to a normal distribution, you might need to use a function that reflects the properties of a normal distribution.

4.
Linear search becomes the only viable option for searching data in the following scenarios:

Unsorted Data: Both binary and interpolation search require the data to be sorted in order to work correctly. If the data is not sorted, linear search is the only option among these three.

No Random Access: Binary and interpolation search require random access to the data, meaning they need to be able to access any element in the data at any time. This is because they work by repeatedly dividing the dataset into smaller pieces. If the data structure does not support random access (like in a linked list), then linear search is the only option.

Unknown Distribution: Interpolation search requires knowledge about the distribution of the data to work effectively. If the distribution of the data is unknown or not uniform, linear search might be a safer option.

Small Datasets: For very small datasets, the overhead of binary and interpolation search might not be worth it, and a simple linear search could be faster.

5.
Linear search can outperform both binary and interpolation search in the case of small datasets.

The reason is that binary and interpolation search have an overhead of calculating the middle or estimated position at each step, which can be more time-consuming than simply scanning through each element in the case of a small dataset.

In addition, both binary and interpolation search require the data to be sorted, which is not a requirement for linear search. If the data is not already sorted, the time taken to sort the data for binary or interpolation search could make linear search faster overall.

If the sought element is near the beginning of the list, linear search can find it in fewer operations than binary or interpolation search, which start from the middle or a proportionally estimated position.

6.
Improving binary and interpolation search to handle unsorted data or data structures without random access is not straightforward, as these characteristics are fundamental to how these algorithms work. However, there are some strategies that can be used to mitigate these issues:

Pre-sorting: If the data is not sorted, one option is to sort it before performing the search. However, this introduces additional time complexity, so it's only beneficial if you're going to be performing multiple searches on the same data.

Indexing: If the data structure does not support random access, one option is to create an index that does. For example, you could create an array of pointers to the elements in the linked list, and then perform binary or interpolation search on the array. Again, this is only beneficial if you're going to be performing multiple searches.

Alternative Algorithms: There are other search algorithms that can handle unsorted data or data structures without random access more efficiently. For example, hash-based search methods can provide constant-time search performance on unsorted data.

Hybrid Approach: For small datasets, a hybrid approach can be used where linear search is used for small datasets and binary or interpolation search is used for larger datasets. This can be beneficial as linear search can be faster for small datasets due to its lower overhead.
